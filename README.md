A shameless Norwegian ripoff of Wordle, made for fun by me for me and my friends to enjoy. I know a lot of other people have copied Wordle as well, but nobody has done it as shamelessly as me and just ripped the entire source code directly from the original and just translated it to Norwegian and replaced the word list with a Norwegian one, but here we are. I'm sorry!

If you hate shameless people like me you can play the original here: https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/
